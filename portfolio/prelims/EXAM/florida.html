<a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Florida" target="_blank"> Florida</a> constituent state of the United States of America. It was admitted as the 27th state in 1845. Florida is the most populous of the southeastern states and the second most populous Southern state after Texas. The capital is Tallahassee, located in the northwestern panhandle.
<br>
<p>Beaches, amusement parks, national parks, and an array of unique tourist attractions make Florida one of the most visited states in America. Families flock to Orlando to thrill the kids with visits to the theme parks, while sunseekers head to the coastal cities like Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and a string of cities along the southern Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>If you're looking for a taste of island life there is nothing quite like the Florida Keys, where life runs at a slower pace. Places like Key West and its cast of characters, seem a world away from the mainland.</p>
