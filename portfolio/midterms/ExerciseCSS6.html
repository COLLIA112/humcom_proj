   The year was 2020. As the world continued to casually implode from the aftermath of the pandemic, with many waiting and watching from the (dis)comfort of their lockdown shacks,
     I remained nestled under my duvet, engulfed in the disasters ravaging another world.<a target="_blank" href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/action/omniscient-reader/list?title_no=2154"> Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint </a> tells the story of Kim Dokja, a lonely 28-year-old office worker,
      who is grappling with the newfound reality of his favourite apocalyptic fiction web-novel coming to life. <br> <br>

In stark contrast to the current <a target="_blank" href="https://www.resiliencelab.us/thought-lab/main-character-syndrome#:~:text=Main%20character%20syndrome%20is%20when,back%20and%20consider%20others'%20perspectives."> “main character syndrome” </a> that has a chokehold on Western millennials, Dokja doesn’t consider himself the protagonist of his own life. 
    For over a decade, and through 1,349 chapters, he’s lived his life vicariously through Yu Junghyeok, the main character of the aforementioned web-novel, 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://omniscient-readers-viewpoint.fandom.com/wiki/Three_Ways_to_Survive_in_a_Ruined_World">Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse</a>. 
    
    On a subway ride home from work, the novel comes to an end, and Dokja, being the sole reader of the novel till its
     conclusion, receives an email from the author containing a TXT copy of the novel… before the world is subsequently plunged into a kill-or-be-killed chaos.<br> <br> 
     When a <a target="_blank" href="https://the-demonic-paradise.fandom.com/wiki/Dokkaebi">dokkaebi </a>(Korean goblin) materialises within the train cart he’s in and gives a quest scenario from Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse, Dokja quickly
      realises that the beloved novel he’s been reading for the past decade has now become reality.<br> <br>

        conclusion, receives an email from the author containing a TXT copy of the novel… before the world is subsequently plunged into a kill-or-be-killed chaos.<br> <br>

As the only man equipped with a full knowledge of future ‘scenarios’ and the destruction to come, Dokja recruits the few survivors in his subway cart and, 
    brandishing the self-proclaimed title of a prophet, tries to overcome the ‘scenarios’. There’s just one problem: Yu Junghyeok is after his neck. Well, initially.
     Saving the world can be a little difficult when the protagonist of said world wants you dead. Thus, wholesomely comedic <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hijinks">hijinks</a> ensue against the backdrop of a collapsing w
     orld ravaged by innumerable beasts, demons, and even constellations. <br> <br>

If you can overlook the constant threat of death, you could say that Dokja is living a reader’s best life. Being able to team up with your favourite character to battle 
    the odds, win against demons and gods, and carve out the story to reach your desired ending (instead of the dismal ending that the author has penned), is a universal longing that 
    all readers have. Many within fandom, myself included, are limited to nurturing these desires on platforms dedicated to fanfiction, so it’s a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cathartic">cathartic</a> experience to see our
     struggles so well documented in the life of Dokja. <br> <br>

The plot is anchored on the somewhat cliched novel-within-a-novel <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">isekai</a> premise that’s taken South Korean entertainment by storm in recent years, 
    and this allows readers moments of poignant relation with Dokja, as they’re able to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/superimpose">superimpose</a> themselves onto him in each setback he faces. There’s something therapeutic
     that comes with reading about someone struggling and overcoming their trauma and suffering, especially when those struggles are made more digestible once introduced with beautiful illustrations.
     <br> <br>
  
Yu Junghyeok isn’t just any main character, he’s also the emotional support that has been keeping Dokja alive for the past ten years. The novel tackles themes of suicide,
     depression, and abuse in a much appreciated delicate manner, that’s well-woven into the narrative, while also striking a good balance between the wholesomeness, comedy, and friendships t
     hat are sprinkled throughout. <br> <br>

Omniscient Reader’s Viewpoint demands re-reading, as little gems can only be fully appreciated on a second, or maybe even third, read through. I’ve consumed my fair share of 
    works in the isekai genre, and I can confidently say that this is the most intriguing one yet. It’s an action-packed, original manhwa, that’s thrilling with each scroll, with an array of
     beautifully developed characters who you can’t help but fall in love with as you accompany them through the many hardships they face.<br> <br>
